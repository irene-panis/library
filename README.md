This is a simple library app used for tracking books; users are able to add books through a form and fill in the title, author, number of pages, and
whether the book has been read. There are also options to delete books from the list as well as toggle books to be read/unread. There is no local storage feature
but it's definitely something that can be implemented in the future. 

This project was meant to be a refresher for basic JavaScript as well as practice for working with objects.
